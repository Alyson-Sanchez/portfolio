        <p> I'm Alyson Sanchez-Rosa, a 24 year old latina Full-Stack developer.</p>

        <p>I was born in Rio Piedras, Puerto Rico (which is now part of San Juan) - but I currently live in Lakeland, Florida.</p>
        <p> I love cute things. As you could probably tell, right? My goal is to show everyone that your projects can be fun and colorful, and don't always have to be minimalistic and sleek and modern. Life is short, use that bubble font!</p>
        <p> All my life, I've always felt a little silly for wanting to make everything beautiful. I'm an artist, and that spills into everything I do. Once something is up and running, I fiddle with settings for hours making sure it is all just perfect. (I can'teven begin to go into how long I've spent on this one.) Default settings? Never heard of her! </p>
        <p> It was a long, winding road until I landed here. I wanted to try all sorts of avenues before ultimately deciding on Full-Stack development. One quick, snappy, extremely fast paced UCF bootcamp later and here I am! I may not have a degree in Computer Science from a fancy tech school, but I learn quickly, I'm earnest, and I sit for hours at this computer until it looks good. (It's hour 8 in this chair while I type this, and I'm nowhere near done with this site.)</p>
        <p> Do I sound like a good addition to your team? Shoot me a message! I'd love to work with you on your next project!</p>
